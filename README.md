## Getting Started

First, create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
and fill in the necessary environment variables.

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun i
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```
